This is Rogelio and Nathan's final project for SE/COMS 3190. 

Our tech stack will include : VSCode, while using Git, GitLab, Excalidraw and Draw.io, React, MySQL or MongoDB,NodeJS, Tailwind, and an API that Nathan found online. We plan to each dedicate 10-15 hours
a week to this project.

The biggest expected issues will involve the back end of the development, having everything integrate nicely will prove to be difficult. from the login feature, to correctly rendering everything in accordingly. Overall, we expect no issues with the frontend as we have had a lot of extensive practice with in-class activities and our previous assignment 3. 

the overview of the assignments of the tasks is as follows: 
Front-end and back-end of login and authentication: Rogelio
Front-end and back-end of filtering feature + search bar : Rogelio
Front-end and back-end of player betting odds: Nathan
Front-end and back-end of team information: Nathan

Note: this is just an overview, there are tasks to be expected to prop up. 

Overall we expect to be finished with the front end of the homepage within the first week and render the API info into the stats page within the first week and a half. This will allow us a week to polish up our UI/UX design accordingly.
